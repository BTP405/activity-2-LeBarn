Approach 1 Answer:
the function creates an array named 'res'. Then the for each loop calls the built-in function 'append' to get a multiple of 2 and adds it into the array 'res'. Once the for each loop reached the nth it returns the entire array list. Finally, The other for loop begins that prints out numbers from 1 to 5 which are the index of an iteration

Approach 2 Answer:
This is a for loop who's terminating condition ends in another for loop as its paramter. The inner for loop it uses the range function that returns a sequence of numbers from 1 to 5. Afterwards, the outer for loop mulitples that an index of the inner for loop by its index and by 2. Lastly, a print statement will output the product in each interation.

Approach 3 Answer:
doubleG(n) takes in the a double type varible named n. The advantage of using this function is that it clarifies what type the arguments of function are. Then, a for loop begins that will call the yield keyword which sends suspends the function's current execution and send a value, specifcally it will output a multiple of 2. Once the for loop reached the n, i will start another for loop that will print out numbers from 1 to 5
